README

This project is a simple Pong-style game created with HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys. The goal is to keep the ball from falling and survive as long as possible, while the score increases over time.

The game is lightweight and runs directly in the browserâ€”just open the index.html file to start playing. The code is organized into three files: index.html for the structure, styles.css for the design, and script.js for the game logic.
